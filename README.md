# Installation

## Android

Add this code to android block in `build.gradle` (Module level).

```sh
android {
    packagingOptions {
        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
        exclude 'META-INF/DEPENDENCIES'
    }
}
```

Include the necessary permission in the Android Manifest.
```sh
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

## iOS
Add `Supported external accessory protocols` in your `info.plist` and then add `com.zebra.rawport`to its.
Add `Privacy - Local Network Usage Description` in your `info.plist`.

# Example
## Getting Started
There is a static class that allows you to create different instances of ZebraPrinter.
```sh
     FutureBuilder(
        future: ZebraUtil.getPrinterInstance(), //required async 
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          if (!snapshot.hasData) {
            return const Center(
              child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
            );
          }
          final zebraPrinter = snapshot.data as ZebraPrinter;
          return PrinterTemplate(zebraPrinter);
        },
      ),
```

You can then set up callbacks for various events:

```sh
    // Discovery callbacks
    zebraPrinter.setOnDiscoveryError((errorCode, errorText) {
      print("Discovery Error: $errorCode, $errorText");
    });
    
    zebraPrinter.setOnPermissionDenied(() {
      print("Permission denied");
    });
    
    // Print completion callbacks (Enhanced!)
    zebraPrinter.setOnPrintComplete(() {
      print("Print completed successfully!");
      // Show success dialog or update UI
    });
    
    zebraPrinter.setOnPrintError((errorMessage) {
      print("Print failed: $errorMessage");
      // Handle specific error (paper out, head open, etc.)
    });
```

## Methods
After configuring the instance, use the following method to start searching for available devices:

```sh
  zebraPrinter.startScanning();
```
It won't stop automatically, if you wish to stop the scan you must call:

 ```sh
  zebraPrinter.stopScanning();
```

To listen for and display any devices (`ZebraDevice`), you can use the Zebra printer `ZebraController`
```sh
ListenableBuilder(
    listenable: zebraPrinter.controller,
    builder: (context, child) {
      final printers = zebraPrinter.controller.printers;
      if (printers.isEmpty) {
        return _getNotAvailablePage();
      }
      return _getListDevices(printers);
    },
  )
```

For connecting to printer, pass ipAddreess for wifi printer or macAddress for bluetooth printer to `connectToPrinter` method.
```sh
 zebraPrinter.connectToPrinter("192.168.47.50");
```

You can set media type between `Lable`, `Journal` and `BlackMark`. You can choose media type by `EnumMediaType`.
```sh
  zebraPrinter.setMediaType(EnumMediaType.BlackMark);
```
You may callibrate printer after set media type. You can use this method.
```sh
zebraPrinter.calibratePrinter();
```
You can set darkness. the valid darkness value are -99,-75,-50,-25,0,25,50,75,100,125,150,175,200.
```sh
  zebraPrinter.setDarkness(25);
```
For print ZPL, you pass ZPL to `print` method.
```sh
  zebraPrinter.print("Your ZPL");
```
For rotate your ZPL without changing your ZPL, you can use this method. You can call this again for normal printing.
```sh
  zebraPrinter.rotate();
```
For disconnect from printer, use `disconnect` method. For battery saver, disconnect from printer when you not need printer.
```sh
  zebraPrinter.disconnect();
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Threading Crashes (Fixed in Latest Version)**
- **Issue**: App crashes with `Methods marked with @UiThread must be executed on the main thread`
- **Solution**: Update to the latest version - this threading issue has been resolved

**Print Completion Detection**
- **Feature**: The plugin now provides real-time print completion callbacks
- **Usage**: Use `setOnPrintComplete()` and `setOnPrintError()` for immediate feedback

**Scanner Behavior**
- **Note**: Once connected to a printer, it may not be detected by subsequent scans
- **Recommendation**: Stop scanning after successful connection for better performance

### Getting Help
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the [Implementation Guide](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed technical information
2. Ensure all required permissions are granted
3. Verify printer is powered on and in discoverable mode
